5.0;1303862400.0;good quality dog food;i have bought several of the vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality the product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better my labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most good quality dog food
1.0;1346976000.0;not as advertised;product arrived labeled as jumbo salted peanutsthe peanuts were actually small sized unsalted not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as jumbo not as advertised
5.0;1267920000.0;my cat loves it;i started my cat on felidae platinum about 3 weeks ago and she loves it shes an older cat somewhat overweight and had a grouchy temperament i first mixed it with her previous food and she figured out which was which  she ate the felidae and left the old food shes now been on just the felidae for about ten days now off the old food entirely and she is a much sweeter happier cat i think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested or something in any case i am a happy purchaser of felidae i dont agree with the previous reviewer that cats dont like it clearly mine does my cat loves it
5.0;1315008000.0;great for fat cats and senior citizens;we have three cats the youngest is about eleven years old another is fifteen and our oldest is well ancient  that is what the vet told us ten years ago  the youngest is a blob  when he lays down he looks like a footstool the other two are arthritic and skinnybr br since we had such success with canidae platinum for senior dogs i figured that wed give it a try for our cats  id had them on low ash purina one urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no ut problemsbr br buster the youngest is still a blob after six months plus on felidae for senior and overweight cats  however the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really feeling better since we changed their food to felidae  even prissy the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her where before when she was on purina one all she wanted to do was to sleepbr br i think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems itll be more effectivebr br however the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life great for fat cats and senior citizens
2.0;1310515200.0;nearly killed the cats;too much of a good thing we worked this kibble in over time slowly shifting the percentage of felidae to national junkfood brand until the bowl was all natural by this time the cats couldnt keep it in or down what a mess weve moved on nearly killed the cats
1.0;1220227200.0;changed formula makes cats sick;as with canidae felidae has also changed their formula  cats do not like change when it comes to their food  and they just had to change it without putting it on their label  we noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell  as you will notice i have also reviewd the canidae and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issuesbr br prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home  if cats get upset because of a change in enviorment or a loud noise they can stop eating  it depends on the cat  two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight  we took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal  it has been a year since then and they are better  then the formula for this food changedbr br we started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us  we asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food  it wasnt until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick  right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and havent suffered one bit like our dogs havebr br cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating  anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it  we have 5 rescued and fixed cats none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formulabr br i urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the fda website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal  as with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals and tell me not to buy it  this is just horrible changed formula makes cats sick
4.0;1320796800.0;best by the case;dont buy just a few of these  i order these by the case  i cant even remember the first time i tasted an anchovy stuffed olive but i have tried several of the brands online and this brand is my favorite best by the case
5.0;1289865600.0;looking for a different flavor;i order these olives a lot they are unlike any other olives out there the subtle flavors of the brine go great with cheeses one of my favorite appetizer treats for guests looking for a different flavor
3.0;1347667200.0;more hotspicy than mccormicks brand;my husband and i are both kind of wimpy when it comes to hot things and this seasoning is just a bit too spicy for us it definitely makes you sweat a bit when youre eating it it was still edible to us by adding a good sized dollop of sour cream but i dont think i would buy it again due to the heat we prefer the milder mccormicks brand of fajita mix ive also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it wasnt as spicy as this mix isbr br if you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind to me it was more than medium hot but not by too muchbr br i gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and its versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it you take a plastic bag a couple of tbs of vegetable oil 14 cup water and mix the seasoning water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for 5 minutes in the meantime it says to stir fry your veggies peppers and onion but i found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and i dont think it affected quality or taste i also used extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oilbr br i have one more package of this to use and next time im going to add more veggies and maybe some chopped tomato to cut the heat a bit more more hotspicy than mccormicks brand
5.0;1266105600.0;ahmad loose imperial blend tea is great for the price;a friend whod been drinking tea for 80 of his 84 years introduced me to this tea a few months ago even took me over to the store and bought me a pound at 7lb in a retail store or a little over 9 with shipping from an online merchant i think its great ive been drinking earl grey english breakfast irish breakfast lapsang souchong assam etc most of them were over 30lb with shipping aside from the lapsang souchong i think this is a great replacement for all the rest has everything im looking for in a strong fullbodied black tea with enough character to keep it from becoming boring my current favorite afternoon tea unless youre extremely jaded or a tea snob youll love it ahmad loose imperial blend tea is great for the price
5.0;1272412800.0;nice tea;i love strong full bodied quality tea and typically drink assam irish breakfast or early grey tea but as the other reviewer noted the price per pound can be discouraging so i have been searching for a quality full bodied tea that wasnt bitter at a more palatable price point and this certainly fits the bill and unlike some other teas where they tend to be better in one form or another ie iced vs hot this tea is excellent in both forms i would certainly recommend this to anyone who prefers that smooth full bodied quality tea that doesnt cost an arm and leg nice tea
5.0;1350864000.0;a fragrant tea;i drink this tea plain without sugar or milk and it has a pleasant aromabr br the price from amazon is cheaper than my local grocery store  one reviewer is right i think it has some herbal smell to make up the aroma  so the label imperial blend kind of implied the herbbr br i am not exactly a black tea drinker so this tea is a surprise and affordable too  i usually prefer white chinese tea like white peony but it is more expensive and requires lower temperature water  but this is black tea and this aroma kind of remind me the softness of white tea a fragrant tea
5.0;1310688000.0;best ahmad tea;ive tried a variety of ahmad tea not because i particularly like this brand but they are just easier to come across  the imperial blend i believe is the most complex yet well balanced of all the ones ive tried its full body like a good cup of assam which by no means overpower the delightful clean taste of darjeerling complete with a long lasting note of bergamot i enjoy it best in the evening it gives a satisfying and relaxing finish to a busy daybr br for those interested in the specifics i use about 3 teaspoons of lose tea in a stainless steel infuser in a 16 oz mug let it steep in 208f water for 23 min take the infuser out and drink it without sugar or milk to savor its sophistication best ahmad tea
5.0;1308009600.0;my favorite tea;i have tried literally dozens of teas since being introduced to the russian custom of preparing and drinking tea and the ahmad imperial blend is probably my favorite of all of these due to the fact that it is equally delicious hot or iced  i buy the threepacks as needed from amazon and go through them rapidly my family loves it and my friends have it in their homes now too try one box of it and you will love it too my favorite tea
5.0;1330819200.0;best tea ever;this is an excellent tea  one of the best i have ever had  it is especially great when you prepare it with a samovar best tea ever
4.0;1264377600.0;delicious;makes a tasty super easy meal fast but high in caloriesbr br the instructions say to saute the veggies first but i recommend cooking the chicken first the chicken takes longer to cook and the raw chicken ontop of veggies just makes a slimy mess i made it with snow peas and carrots only i dont like the little corn  added some red pepper flakes for heat and served ontop of rice  it came out wonderful dinner on the table in less than 30mins delicious
5.0;1346025600.0;best bloody mary mixer;i think i have tried just about every bloody mary mixer on the market at one time or the other  most have too much sugar or worst corn syrup  this mixer is all natural ingredients and very tasty it does have a little kick enjoy best bloody mary mixer
5.0;1338163200.0;the best;might be a little spicy for some but this stuff rocks i use 12 and12 with v8 for a milder version  or the best is a bloody caesarbr half mix half clamato the best
1.0;1345593600.0;not good;this candy is not as described the middle is almost hard it is not a silky or smooth filling as describedbr looks and tastes like its way past its expiration datebr would never reccommend this paid a good chunk of cash for nothing not good
5.0;1347235200.0;love this tea;i started drinking the power slim tea when i was on the hcg diet to help curb cravings since i liked it so well i tried some of the others and i am now hooked  they are so satisfying that i drink them all the time  the energy gives you that extra pickmeup in the afternoons that helps keep me going all day no matter how long love this tea
5.0;1343692800.0;just give me some watermelon and citron sea salt;i cannot live without this citron falksalt it is wonderful on watermelon fish almost any food requiring salt and in my world it all does  just try it on red juicy watermelon wonderful experience just give me some watermelon and citron sea salt
5.0;1303257600.0;big tub o salt;these things are huge i love the way the crystals crunch and the flavor is not too overpowering or too subtle this lemony flavor is my favoriteits good on almost everything youll have plenty of flavored salt for a long time if you buy this big tub o salt
2.0;1302307200.0;taste is neutral quantity is deceitful;the taste of these white cheddar flat breads is like a regular cracker  which is not bad except that i bought them because i wanted a cheese tastebr br what was a huge disappointment how misleading the packaging of the box is the photo on the box i bought these in store makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads expanding the length and width of the box wrong the plastic tray that holds the crackers is about 2 smaller all around  leaving you with about 15 or so small flatbreadsbr br what is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and ecofriendly packaging fail they used a huge box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers not ecofriendly at allbr br would i buy these again no  i feel ripped off the other crackers like sesame tarragon give you a littlebr more bang for your buck and have more flavor taste is neutral quantity is deceitful
5.0;1341878400.0;eukanuba puppy small breed dog food;this is the ultimate puppy food  the kibbles are great for small breeds  high in digestible nutrients as opposed to fillers some companies use  less waste results from the high quality ingredients  i have been hunting training showing and handling various breeds of dogs for nearly 40 years with multiple national champions  i have been highly satisfied with eukanubas quality and the results i have obtained feeding their foods  my recent purchases are with wag through amazoncom  their prices are the best i have found and they are very good at shipping immediately on items in stock eukanuba puppy small breed dog food
4.0;1331251200.0;high quality but it gave my dog wicked gas;the recommendation when we bought our puppies lhasabichon mix and lhasapoodle mix was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned this is a somewhat expensive food so i cant say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed homebr br let me just say this i have had small dogs before never have i seen such gas issues both of them consistently had foul gas consistently usually when theyre sitting on our laps but you know theyre dogsbr br when we got through the first bag of this stuff we purchased more on amazon it was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of i think a 15 lb bag at petco but they continued to have gas i mean they loved the food dont get me wrong and they loved it more when wed mix in some water and it would be like soft food somehow that made their gas worse but i think ill have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down cant blame the food itself for gluttonybr br eventually we switched their food no more farting i think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies they just need that in their diet i think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful they said up until 1 year yeah right you try dealing with gas for that long around 6 mos of age we switched to puppychow much better granted they dont like it as much but we humans like it a whole lot better high quality but it gave my dog wicked gas
5.0;1330387200.0;great tasting green tea and such a great deal;a very delicate green tea with a smooth light taste and an subtle floral tones and no bitter aftertastebr br in the 20 years we have been drinking ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed the superb quality of ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the yearsbr br i am so happy to find ahmad teas available here thanks amazon because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away the current deal for the pack of 6 is superb much cheaper than i can find locallybr br this is a great tasting tea which i am happy to recommend great tasting green tea and such a great deal

2.0;1245456000.0;disappointed;ive been drinking this tea for the past 8 or 10 years usually buying a box or two when visiting large metropolitan areas where many middleeastern stores carry loose ahmad teas usually at 57 for a pound box  ive always considered it an unremarkable but robust tea with enough aroma and taste and beautiful reddish color perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own but a decent base for mixesbr this tea however is nothing of the sort freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell and the brewed tea is weak flat and tasteless  somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore so you get a lot of tea for the money but the quality is such that you might as well drink lipton bags they are not that much worse disappointed
5.0;1338508800.0;wonderful;i love love love this deal  its way fun to pick from so many teas and chocolates and ciders as well as many coffees the other outfits that assemble samplers are boring  they do the choosing and from a much narrower range the sellers here are very nice also and will answer questions via email about the slightly confusing ordering method its easy if you want great packaging forget it  they ship fast and the kups are just tossed loose in a box who cares wonderful
5.0;1350172800.0;best way to buy kcups;once youve tried some random sampler packs and now are overloaded with decafsextra bolds or teas this is a great way to get exactly the brands or style that you want  received the order in a couple of days and was exactly what i ordered  this was my second order and ill be ordering this item again best way to buy kcups

5.0;1334361600.0;super  superfoods are super easy;wow  this product is very impressive i bought the 8oz blueberry and was pleased with packaging price and shipping  the powder dissolves instantly  even in water  ive just been mixing a 14 tsp in a small glass of water for now and drinking it down and it tastes great but will add it to my smoothies and juiced fruit juices next this product is so economical compared to purchasing fresh blueberries especially because there is no waste due to mold or overripe berries thrown away  i think you could add this to baked or unbaked foods as well  im excited to add more of the superfoods to my diet in this fast and easy way i definitely will being trying the other flavors soon super  superfoods are super easy
1.0;1344556800.0;sad outcome;five minutes in one tentacle was bitten off ball inside cracked in half not durable enough to be a dog toy disappointed  so is the dog  sad outcome
4.0;1346889600.0;best energy shot for me;i am chemical sensitive as well as sugarfree i have been using this product for over a year i use it maybe once a week at the most i drink 12 the bottle and then boost my energy after an hour or two depending on how i feel imo this doesnt replace my am coffee but is sweet in the early afternoon when i start to fade once in a while i drink a full bottle before a workout ive been drinking guayaki yerba mate teas for years compared to the many toxic energy boosters out there i highly recommend this this product is clean and doesnt leave nasty chems behind in the body try it before you judge from a review  everyones body reacts differently best energy shot for me
1.0;1339804800.0;dont waste your money;i felt energized within five minutes but it lasted for about 45 minutes i paid 399 for this drink i could have just drunk a cup of coffee and saved my money dont waste your money
2.0;1317772800.0;if you cant handle caffeine this is not for you;yes its probably healthier than 5hour energy or starbucks shots but if youre looking to avoid a caffeine overload this is still not for you most energy drinks cannot be made w out a high dosage of caffeine i believe the caffeine content of 1 guayaki shot is 150 ml  probably lower than other unhealthy energy shot drinks but i believe most other people avoid the top brands bc they contain too much caffeine andor sugar if you do not react well to caffeine guayaki is not a good buy either i definitely feel an energy boost w 1 full guayaki shot but not w out all the other caffeine side effects  irritability nervousness moodswings caffeine overdose is why i stopped drinking coffee but it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safebr br now youre not sensitive to caffeine then its a great buy its not loaded w sugar the taste is easy and pleasant its not loaded w a bunch of chemicals like 5hour shots or starbucks drinks and the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your bodyweightbr br side note  if you want to feel energized during the day have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy if you cant handle caffeine this is not for you
5.0;1347321600.0;yum yummy yummier;these nature valley nut lovers variety pack was perfect although i wasnt sure about the peanut butter bar it was excellent i loved the roasted almond roasted pecan and the peanut butterbr br i will definately buy from this seller again quick shipping and very fresh yum yummy yummier
1.0;1348099200.0;reeks like chemicals;i so wish i would have read this review before purchasing two gallons of this oil for my health issues it reeks like a chemical rubber smell this smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid when i called to report the situation to the company sabrina told me i would have to pay to send them a sample to have tested by a lab unbelievable good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund including shipping the product is faulty period i will never order anything from this company again and do not recommend it to anyone based on this horrible customer service and lack of responsibility and ownership reeks like chemicals
2.0;1345161600.0;disappointed;this product has a strong aftertaste of crayola crayonsbr br i am in the process of trying different brands of coconut oils for cooking purposes  upon opening the plastic container the aroma of crayons immediately fills the room and this flavor permeates the food that is cooked in itbr br i suspect the source of the problem is the plastic used in the plastic container as i have not experienced this with any of the other brands purchasedbr br to date my favorite coconut oil is distributed by barleans  the flavor is fantastic  however they do not supply a gallonsized tuband dr mercola has the best product in that size category disappointed
5.0;1348444800.0;great for glutenfree lifestyle;had this shipped to my sister who follows a glutenfree eating plan and she reports that it is very versatile and easier than grinding almonds for a crispy crust on chicken and fish filets also uses it in place of bread crumbs in meatloaf and meatballs  stays moist when added in place of wheat flour in baking too good product good value great for glutenfree lifestyle
5.0;1337040000.0;my dog loves these;these are healthy and my mixed llasa tibetan terrier adores them and they are healthy and his breath doesnt smell and his teeth are in good shape because of such products a great healthy product my dog loves these

3.0;1295222400.0;manufacturing problems diminish product;i have used and liked sugar in the raw for many years after being introduced to it in a starbucks my most recent purchase however was disappointing the sugar was lighter in color and had a crystal size maybe 14th of the regular size having large crystals was something i always really liked about sugar in the raw it enhanced the quality of mixed drinks and of lattes i called their hotline to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar they have had many complaints of a similar nature this they claimed also reduced the crystal size they said this problem should go away with their newer crop the representative said that the newcrop sugar will have a 610 digit date code without any spaces that ends with a 1 and no letters the trailing digits are a date code using the julian calendar my recent badpurchase had a space after the initial sequence of numbers and then ended with a 51a bottom line their current product is not much better than much cheaper products when they get a better crop ill go back to purchasing sugar in the raw manufacturing problems diminish product
5.0;1339804800.0;good product but terrible agricultural practices;sugar in the rawtm please harvest cane wo burningbr to be delivered to hcsbr dear sugar in the raw folksbr br we who buy your product care about the environment and wed like to know that you care too when you burn the cane fields on maui it adds to the co2 and worsens climate change and the smoke from your burning is damaging the lungs of your workers your workers children and the residents of mauibr br we love your product and want you to change to noburn harvesting so we can continue to buy it knowing we arent contributing to global warming and lung diseasebr br  good product but terrible agricultural practices
5.0;1228089600.0;sugar in the raw;love this sugar  i also get muscavado sugar and they are both great to use in place of regular white sugar recommend sugar in the raw
4.0;1312934400.0;excellent but not perfect;this is a delicious sugar it has a pretty light brown color and delicious aroma but the granules are quite big however  bigger than plain refined sugar this makes is difficult to cream butter and sugar together but if you use it in a recipe where you will melt the sugar first before baking it or if you use it to brew beer and plan to boil it to melt it it is a great product it would be the perfect sugar if only the granules were a bit finer excellent but not perfect
4.0;1302739200.0;good product;i only use raw sugar it did seem a little smaller than the normal crystals but it is still good will buy again good product
5.0;1297814400.0;youll never use white sugar again;this sugar is very good  use this in your coffee cereal etc for a week and youll never go back to white sugar white sugar will taste terrible  plus from what ive read this raw sugar contains a lot of minerals that are missing in our dietsbr br the product was delivered fast and wellpackaged  my only complaint is the price  i wish i could find raw sugar cheaper  i would be happy to buy in bulk but this is the cheapest i have found youll never use white sugar again
3.0;1296950400.0;thanks for the review scott;i thought this was a great buy but as noted by scott d the molasses content was not up to par  i loved the higher molasses content sugar in the raw  unfortunately what i purchased recently does not have the higher molasses content and i have twelve 24 ounce bags  i guess ill watch for the next crop thanks for the review scott
5.0;1296777600.0;great;i really love this sugar and pricewise its much cheaper to buy it here on amazon compared to anywhere else great
5.0;1285718400.0;awesome sugar;love this sugar it tastes so much better and isnt as overly sweet tasting as regular sugar weve used it in quite a few baking items and they always turn out very good the price that amazon has this set at is very good to and makes it easy to use this for everyday stuff awesome sugar
4.0;1260835200.0;great product  weak packaging;cant say anything bad about sugar in the raw  i like it better than the other natural sugars better consistency and  i know it doesnt matter  but better color unfortunately one of the natural paper bags got torn a bit in the box  it didnt look like the box was damaged so i cant tell how it happened but it was sort of pain to clean up half a bag that spilled all over the inside of the box and our kitchen when i opened it  not sure what the solution is and id order it again but if it happens again id switch to one of the brands that ship in an unnatural plastic bag great product  weak packaging
5.0;1253750400.0;excellent;great service items arrived faster than expected very efficient will use this seller again i highly recommend this seller thank you for the excellent service excellent
5.0;1343692800.0;excellent for gf;please ignore the onestar comments if you check the bag the main ingredient is in fact whole grain brown rice and the second is rice flower with anything that is gluten free you have to add another binder which is where the corn flour comes in for someone who has celiac disease and cannot have sunchips because they contain wheat a key binder to any chip cookie or cereal this is an excellent product my spouse and i buy these a lot because they are gluten free and absolutely delicious excellent for gf
5.0;1315353600.0;amazing;best flavor ever  im addicted  they are all good but these are by far the best  i could live on these  and there is no need for anymore to say amazing
5.0;1275436800.0;very tasty chips;so many healthy products dont taste very good  or taste good when you first try them and then go downhill  ive had these chips on more than one occasion and they are very tasty  ive served them to guests twice and both times they wanted to know what they were and where to get them its also nice to have something glutenfree for friends who are borderline diabeticbut i would eat them anyway very tasty chips
5.0;1247529600.0;excellent taste;this is one of the best tasting crisps i have ever eaten i only buy it on special occassions because i know ill eat the whole bag excellent taste
1.0;1280880000.0;over priced chips and lack rice taste;i paid 179 for a 2 ounce pkg of these at lunch today i bought them because brown rice is a good carb  as soon as i tasted one and it tasted like a corn chip i checked the ingredients  the name is deceptive  these have masa corn flour listed in the ingredients and it overwhelms the taste  i wont buy these again  i can get sunchips for less money and similar taste over priced chips and lack rice taste
5.0;1283817600.0;rotel saves me on a daily basis;i use the rotel mild and i love this product so muchit saves me on a daily basis  if youre trying to cook lower fat healthier foods and in a hurry this stuff makes it so much easier  ever notice that some canned tomatos have a weird tin can taste when you make spagehetti sauce or whatever  for some reason this product doesnt have that  it tastes so good you can just dump it in with a can of beans heat and eatbr br or add some chili powder and now you have chili soup  i also make indian dishes with this and spicey spaghetti sauce  i also prefer this to most canned salsas so it works for things like quesadillas if you drain the liquid offbr br none of my local grocery stores carry it at all nor do they carry anything like it  so i have to pay amazons inflated price to order this by the case  i dont like that im paying a higher price but i love love love the product rotel saves me on a daily basis
5.0;1261785600.0;its fabulous but not from amazon;the price on this product certainly raises my attention on compairing amazon price with the local stores i can get a can of this rotel at my local kroger for 1 dissapointing its fabulous but not from amazon
3.0;1221177600.0;too expensive;howdy yallbr br the actual product is very good  id rate the item a 4 on its own however its only one dollar at the local grocery and   twenty eight dollars per twelve pack  these are running almost two and a half dollars eachbr br as i said too expensive sigh  i was really hoping to get them at something approaching the local costbr br take carebr lee too expensive
3.0;1280534400.0;not mild enough for me lol;nothing wrong with the product but i sure had to mix it with lots of other ingredients to make it edible to me in texas i was called a babymouth  not into very spicyhot foodsbr br for comparison im comfortable with tostitos medium chunky salsa 1 can of this milder rotel mixed with 2 slightly larger cans of diced tomatoes was still way too hot for me to use as salsa for chips i used some of this to make a sort of southwestern cornbread that was good though not mild enough for me lol
5.0;1276214400.0;great natural energy;this is a fantastic product and i wish it was readily available in most stores its taste is not the greatest but its a 25 oz shot and its gone in a second it tastes more or less like a concentrated sweet tea for the record ive had 5 hour energy and that tastes far worse i will put up the taste for the results its got 150mg of caffeine which is the equivalent of the big red bulls and monsters i cant stand sucralose and sugar substitutes and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it the sugar is at 9g which isnt horrible i used to drink 4 16oz red bulls a day for the caffeine and this gives me far better energy and is much more subtle my preference is black coffee but i cant drink 812 cups a day anymore overall steaz does it right great natural energy
5.0;1280188800.0;i like this stuff;i have to get up really early to work out before work and i get super tired by the middle of the afternoon i was drinking one 5 hour energy usually extra strength each day it worked well but gave me a jittery feeling almost headachy but not quite my husband got me to try this and i was skeptical but for me it works as well if not better than the 5 hour energy and doesnt give me that jittery almostheadache feelingbr br i dont mind the tasteit reminds me of the inside of a fig newton mmm and the price is ok on amazon anyway at my grocery store they were almost 3 each yikebr br and its organicso i can feel good about it right its all about me feeling good i like this stuff
5.0;1268092800.0;great energy;i bought these for my husband and he said they are the best energy shots out there he takes one in the mornings and works hard all day good stuff great energy
5.0;1311292800.0;the best energy shot out there smooth and organic;if you want an organic energy shot your choices are this one from steaz and the assorted flavors from guayaki guayaki yerba mate is actually in the steaz energy shot and energy drinks and they both use sambazon acai so there are some similarities in ingredientsbr br great energy burst for 4 hours on a steaz energy shot and no withdrawals or headaches afterwards plan on drinking one every day at lunch at work this will help me cut down on my iced coffees which are not helping my calorie intakebr br already ordering 12packs on subscribe and save 2 per month great value the best energy shot out there smooth and organic
5.0;1299024000.0;fantastic natural energy;i was looking for a natural energy shot that works and i found it steaz energy shot is my favoritebr br i recently had gastric bypass surgery so tons of sugar is a nono and im also allergic to sucralose splenda so most other energy drinks are outbr br i tried bazi energy shots and they didnt work as well as steaz and definitely didnt taste as well these have a taste thats almost like cocacolanot bad at allbr br if youre looking for natural energy give these a try fantastic natural energy
5.0;1294790400.0;way better than guayaki;i had tried both of the guayaki energy shots and i dont like the taste of either of them this one has more natural caffeine and tastes much better i like them cold for sure my husband and i take these on road trips in a little cooler with ice and waters and we dont have to make stops for coffee especially on the turnpikes where its just way too expensive its worth the  per shot we normally split them im really sensitive to caffeine even the natural kind so i get a little weird if i drink the whole thing but thats the same for coffee too for me my husband drinks the whole shot and gets a nice wake up boost i would recommend these over any of the sinthetic shots out there you can feel good about putting this in your body ill be ordering again soon for sure  way better than guayaki
3.0;1259971200.0;doesnt taste that good but provides you the energy;i purchased it because it was on sale in terms of the energy it provides it works but the taste leaves something to be desired i tried mixing it with some water to make it more drinkable doesnt taste that good but provides you the energy
5.0;1335139200.0;favorite energy shot and all natural too;ive tried 5hour energy red rain nos and other energy shots  this is my favorite in terms of taste and effect  plus its somewhat reassuring to know that natural ingredients are used  sometimes i wonder what im really putting into my body with some of the other brands  i purchase a box about once every 2 months for the past 2 years favorite energy shot and all natural too
5.0;1334793600.0;natural energy boost;if youre looking for an energy boost without artificial sweeteners and other chemicals this is a great option  the taste is decent and it is a nice smooth uplift without jitters natural energy boost
5.0;1320451200.0;best energy shot i have ever tasted;i first found steaz berry energy shots at a local organic market i bought two bottles which cost just under three dollars each i fell in love instantly the drink is delicious  i can taste the yerba mate and the acai juice like a slightly bitter fruity chocolate honey tea i am very sensitive to sucralose splenda which is in so many energy drinks these days best energy shot i have ever tasted

5.0;1333411200.0;flavor getting better energy is great;ive been buying and drinking this for over a year now and the energy boost is excellent with a continuous 6hour effect the most recent shipments seem to have improved the flavor slightly as well or perhaps im getting more used to it i dont drink it for the flavor but its not as heinous as the fake flavors found in the other nonorganic energy shots flavor getting better energy is great
1.0;1326758400.0;so awful i can barely describe;this is the first time ive really been misled by other reviews on amazon i like 5hr energy i find rain ok and so i thought id try this product based on the reviews boy am i sorry i gagged getting one bottle down even with my nose pinched really and it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards 8 tic tacs at once did not get rid of it but worst of all within an hour i was yawning and drowsy unless you really like things that taste of a weird teaflavored cough syrup and dont work dont buy this i dont know what to do with the other 11 bottles big fail so awful i can barely describe

5.0;1341014400.0;very good coffee;i love ordering whole bean coffee on amazon  i like this so much that this my first product review  i have to say that im usually not a big fan of flavored coffee but i thought i would give it a try  when my husband started grinding it up i could smell it throughout the house  sometimes with flavored coffees the smell is there but the taste isnt  however not with this one  im now going to order another flavor from this company and will give it a try very good coffee
5.0;1290384000.0;very tasty;i love this coffee i do wish it came already ground as i dont have a grinder and use a blender instead but its worth it many flavored coffees ive tried only seem to have a flavored odor that doesnt reach the coffee but this one manages both very tasty
5.0;1268265600.0;excellent coffee;this brand of coffee has been available in my local stores for some time  ive believe the company is local  ive been drinking it for quite some time and have not tired of it  im particularly fond of the turtle sundae but all the flavors are good  i cant say that ive had a bad onebr br as it turns out its less expensive to order it from amazon and have it show up at my front door than it is for me to run out to the local walmart to get it  its a no brainer  try it if you like rich flavored coffee youll like it excellent coffee
5.0;1332460800.0;hot;it is hot i love it tasty and a little sweet i usually scoff at salsas labeled as hot but this one lives up to its billing hot
5.0;1250208000.0;hot and delicious;i consume about a jar every two weeks of this either adding it to fajitas or using it as a corn chip dip  it is hot but after awhile the medium salsa suprema was too mild for me hot and delicious
5.0;1350691200.0;swiss chalet;service was great but i meant to buy swiss chalet chicken sauce not the marinade br br love the sauce  have yet to try the marinade swiss chalet

5.0;1345334400.0;coffeemate coffee creamer hazelnut;i love the convenience of the singles the best creamer aroundtaste is just like the big bottle i can stick them in my purse and take them to work coffeemate coffee creamer hazelnut
5.0;1342137600.0;no broken creamers;these creamers come in 4 packs of 25 i have taken one to work and opened one for home so far and havent found a single broken or leaking creamer yet i usually have way too much cream and sugar in my coffee but with these it is easy for me to cut down on the sweetness because i wont allow myself more than 2 creamers per cup i think this is definitely the best option for buying creamers from amazon since all the other listings have a lot of complaints about creamers breaking in shipping no broken creamers
4.0;1340582400.0;shipped great;even though we are international delight fans we were not completely dissapointed by this product we had no problem with the shipment but the creamer itself is thinner than international delight other than that we are happy d shipped great
5.0;1347840000.0;love this gum;ive been using this gum for several years now to help keep my appetite in check  the bold taste shocks my tongue into thinking im really eating something so it is easier to fend off cravings  i cant seem to find anything but expensive single packs in stores so i depend of amazon for my supply  tastes good to me love this gum
5.0;1346976000.0;tastes great;not sure what the other reviewer was upset about  ive ordered this gum from this particular seller a number of times and it tastes great this is my favorite gum and for some reason it is impossible to find in nyc tastes great
1.0;1335916800.0;terrible taste;i have always loved flare 5 gum by wrigleys and it was the only gum i ever purchased  within the last 6 months or so it has become impossible to find in my area no grocery stores or gas stations carried it anymore  out of desperation i checked online and found it available through amazon  i was thrilled  i ordered a large lot and waited anxiously for its arrival  sadly it took about 9 days to reach me but i ripped open the box and popped a stick in my mouth expecting that wonderful cinnamon burst of flavor that lasts for hours  within seconds i had to spit it out  it tasted like plastic  i checked the expiration date on my lot and it was not expired  i decided to give it another try and took another stick out it smelled okay looked okay but the taste was the same  horrible plastic taste ugh  naturally i thought i should return the product but this is not an option with amazon as it is considered a grocery item  looks like i have 15 packs of plasticflavored gum to hand out to unsuspecting people that ask if i have any gum terrible taste
5.0;1344556800.0;product as described;product is great and as expected however it took two months to get to me i also like that i was able to purchase these packages in bulk product as described
